# Contributing to Fig

Thanks for taking the time to build the future of the terminal with us! ðŸ¥³

We want to make contributing to Fig as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug

- Submitting feature requests

- Contributing content or feature changes

  

## Our Repos

We use GitHub to host code, track issues and feature requests, and accept pull requests.

Here are some of our primary repos.

[withfig/fig](https://github.com/withfig/fig): The central repo. Most issues go here. We will direct you to the right place if not.

[withfig/autocomplete](https://github.com/withfig/autocomplete): Collection of all specs for [autocomplete](https://fig.io/docs/autocomplete). Contribute new specs, update old specs, and file issues for existing specs here.

[withfig/config](https://github.com/withfig/config): Fig's default configuration at install. Contains all installation and update scripts.

[withfig/docs](https://github.com/withfig/docs): Fig's docs!



## Proposing changes

Fig welcomes code contributions via pull request. Here are a few styling guides to keep in mind:

**Git Commit Messages**

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line



## Bug reports and feature requests

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs as well as new feature requests. If you have any input, [open a new issue](https://github.com/withfig/fig)! If you're not sure where a bug report or feature goes, start at the [withfig/fig](https://github.com/withfig/fig) repo, and we will direct you.
