Most issues are made in this repo. Only create issues in other repos for the following:

- [withfig/autocomplete](https://github.com/withfig/autocomplete): Issues with specific completion specs (e.g. git, aws...) or the completion spec standard (e.g. the standard doesn't work with this specific type of CLI argument) 
- [withfig/config](https://github.com/withfig/config): Issues with Fig's installation and update scripts (e.g. perhaps the Fig CLI is not being added to your $PATH because of a custom set up or shell)
